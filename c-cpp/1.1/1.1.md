Excellent. Let's begin with the first module.

This module is designed to build a rock-solid foundation in the C language, focusing not just on the classic elements, but on the modern practices and features that ensure robust and efficient code. We'll bridge the gap between "textbook C" and the C used in professional, high-performance environments today.

-----

### **Part 1: The Modern C Language (C11, C17, C23)**

### **Module 1.1: Core Concepts of Modern C**

#### **Objective**

To master the foundational elements of C, with a strong emphasis on memory safety, modern type system features, and the powerful, yet often misunderstood, aspects of the language like the preprocessor and C11's concurrency model.

-----

### **1. Memory Management: The Art of Precision**

In C, you are in complete control of memory, which is both a source of immense power and great responsibility. Modern C development practices focus on minimizing the risks associated with this control.

##### **A. The `malloc` Family and `free`**

  * **`void* malloc(size_t size)`**: Allocates a block of memory of a specific `size` in bytes. The memory is *uninitialized*, meaning it contains garbage values.
  * **`void* calloc(size_t num, size_t size)`**: Allocates memory for an array of `num` elements, each of `size` bytes. The key difference from `malloc` is that the allocated memory is *zero-initialized*. This is slightly slower but can prevent bugs from uninitialized data.
  * **`void* realloc(void* ptr, size_t new_size)`**: Resizes a previously allocated memory block pointed to by `ptr`. This is a powerful function, but it has complex behavior:
      * It might expand or shrink the memory in-place.
      * It might allocate a new block, copy the old data, and free the old block.
      * If it fails, it returns `NULL` and *leaves the original pointer `ptr` untouched*. This is a critical error-handling detail.
  * **`void free(void* ptr)`**: Deallocates a block of memory, returning it to the system. `free(NULL)` is a safe, guaranteed no-op.

**Modern Best Practices & Common Pitfalls:**

1.  **Check for `NULL`:** Always check the return value of `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc` to ensure the allocation succeeded.

2.  **The `realloc` Idiom:** Never assign the result of `realloc` back to the original pointer directly. This can cause a memory leak if `realloc` fails.

    ```c
    // BAD: Leaks memory on failure
    my_ptr = realloc(my_ptr, new_size);
    if (my_ptr == NULL) { /* Uh oh, we lost the original pointer! */ }

    // GOOD: Safe and clean
    void* temp_ptr = realloc(my_ptr, new_size);
    if (temp_ptr == NULL) {
        // Handle the error, my_ptr is still valid
        free(my_ptr); // Or keep it to try again later
        // ...
    } else {
        my_ptr = temp_ptr;
    }
    ```

3.  **`sizeof` with a Variable, Not a Type:** This makes your code more maintainable. If the type of the pointer changes, you don't have to change the `sizeof` call.

    ```c
    // Less maintainable
    int* p = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));

    // More maintainable
    int* p = malloc(10 * sizeof(*p));
    ```

##### **B. Flexible Array Members (C99 and later)**

This feature allows you to create a `struct` that ends with an array of an unspecified size. You allocate memory for the `struct` and the array all at once. This is more efficient than a separate allocation for a pointer member because it improves cache locality and requires only one `free` call.

**Example: A Custom String Struct**

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    size_t length;
    char contents[]; // Flexible array member - must be the last member
} String;

int main(void) {
    size_t new_str_len = 11; // "hello world"

    // Allocate space for the struct AND the array data in one call
    String* my_string = malloc(sizeof(String) + new_str_len + 1); // +1 for null terminator
    if (my_string == NULL) {
        return 1;
    }

    my_string->length = new_str_len;
    strcpy(my_string->contents, "hello world");

    printf("String: '%s', Length: %zu\n", my_string->contents, my_string->length);

    free(my_string); // One free cleans up everything

    return 0;
}
```

-----

### **2. The Modern C Type System**

Modern C provides powerful tools for compile-time checks and creating more expressive, type-safe code.

##### **A. `_Static_assert` (C11)**

Performs an assertion at compile time. If the condition is false, the compilation fails with an error message. This is invaluable for validating assumptions about your environment or types.

**Example:**

```c
#include <limits.h>

// Ensure long is at least 64 bits for this program to work correctly
_Static_assert(sizeof(long) * CHAR_BIT >= 64, "This code requires a 64-bit long type.");

// Ensure a struct has a specific size (e.g., for hardware interaction)
struct HardwareRegister {
    unsigned int status;
    unsigned int control;
};
_Static_assert(sizeof(struct HardwareRegister) == 8, "HardwareRegister must be 8 bytes.");
```

##### **B. `_Generic` Expressions (C11)**

Provides a way to select an expression based on the type of a controlling expression. This is C's native mechanism for type-generic programming, primarily used within macros.

**Example: A Type-Safe `max` Macro**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define functions for specific types
int max_int(int a, int b) { return a > b ? a : b; }
double max_double(double a, double b) { return a > b ? a : b; }

// The _Generic macro dispatches to the correct function at compile time
#define max(a, b) _Generic((a), \
    int: max_int(a, b), \
    double: max_double(a, b), \
    default: max_int(a, b) \
)

int main(void) {
    printf("Max of 5 and 10 is %d\n", max(5, 10));         // Calls max_int
    printf("Max of 3.14 and 1.618 is %f\n", max(3.14, 1.618)); // Calls max_double

    return 0;
}
```

-----

### **3. The C Preprocessor: Beyond Simple Macros**

While often a source of bugs, the preprocessor is a powerful tool when used correctly. Advanced techniques like stringification and token pasting allow for sophisticated code generation.

  * **Stringification (`#`)**: Turns a macro argument into a string literal.
  * **Token Pasting (`##`)**: Concatenates two tokens into a single new token.

**Example: A Macro for Defining and Registering Functions**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Imagine a system where functions must be registered by name
void register_command(const char* name, void (*func)(void)) {
    printf("Registering command: %s\n", name);
    // Registration logic would go here...
}

void command_quit(void) { printf("Executing quit.\n"); }
void command_start(void) { printf("Executing start.\n"); }

// This macro creates the function and a registration call for it
#define DEFINE_COMMAND(name) \
    void command_##name(void); /* Forward declare the function */ \
    __attribute__((constructor)) /* GCC/Clang specific: run this before main() */ \
    void register_##name(void) { \
        register_command(#name, command_##name); \
    } \
    void command_##name(void) /* The actual function definition follows */


// Use the macro to define our functions
DEFINE_COMMAND(quit) {
    printf("Executing quit.\n");
}

DEFINE_COMMAND(start) {
    printf("Executing start.\n");
}

int main(void) {
    printf("main() has started. Commands should be registered.\n");
    // At this point, register_quit and register_start have already run
    return 0;
}

```

*Output:*

```
Registering command: quit
Registering command: start
main() has started. Commands should be registered.
```

### **4. Concurrency in C11: `<threads.h>` and `<stdatomic.h>`**

C11 standardized basic threading and atomic operations, providing a portable way to write multi-threaded code without relying on platform-specific APIs like POSIX threads or Windows threads.

##### **A. `<threads.h>`**

Provides functions for thread creation (`thrd_create`), mutexes (`mtx_t`, `mtx_init`, `mtx_lock`), condition variables (`cnd_t`), and thread-local storage (`tss_t`).

##### **B. `<stdatomic.h>`**

Provides atomic types (`atomic_int`, `atomic_flag`) and operations (`atomic_fetch_add`, `atomic_exchange`) that guarantee indivisible read-modify-write operations, essential for lock-free data structures.

**Example: A Simple Thread-Safe Counter**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <threads.h>
#include <stdatomic.h>

#define NUM_THREADS 10
#define INCREMENTS_PER_THREAD 1000000

// Using an atomic integer guarantees thread safety without a mutex
atomic_int counter = ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(0);

int thread_worker(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < INCREMENTS_PER_THREAD; ++i) {
        // This operation is atomic: no other thread can interrupt it
        atomic_fetch_add(&counter, 1);
    }
    return 0;
}

int main(void) {
    thrd_t threads[NUM_THREADS];

    // Create threads
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; ++i) {
        thrd_create(&threads[i], thread_worker, NULL);
    }

    // Wait for all threads to complete
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; ++i) {
        thrd_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }

    printf("Expected counter value: %d\n", NUM_THREADS * INCREMENTS_PER_THREAD);
    printf("Actual counter value:   %d\n", counter);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Practical Exercise for Module 1.1**

Now it's time to combine these concepts.

**Task:** Build a simple, thread-safe key-value store in C.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Data Structure:**
      * Create a `struct` for a single key-value pair (both strings).
      * Create a main `struct` for the store itself. It should use a **flexible array member** to hold an array of key-value pairs.
2.  **Memory Management:**
      * Write functions to create (`store_create`), resize (`store_add_item`), and destroy (`store_destroy`) the store.
      * Properly use `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free`. Follow the safe `realloc` idiom.
3.  **Concurrency:**
      * The store must be thread-safe. Use a mutex (`mtx_t` from `<threads.h>`) to protect the data structure during additions.
      * The store should also keep a count of how many items have been added. This count should be an **atomic integer** (`atomic_int`) from `<stdatomic.h>`.
4.  **Type Safety (Bonus):**
      * Use `_Static_assert` to ensure that `sizeof(void*)` is at least 4, a basic sanity check for the target platform.

This exercise will force you to manage memory carefully, handle dynamic resizing, ensure thread safety with modern C11 primitives, and think about the structure of a non-trivial C application.

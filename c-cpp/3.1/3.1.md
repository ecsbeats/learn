Of course. Let's start the final part of the course, where we bridge the gap between writing code and building real-world, deployable software. This begins with mastering build systems.

### **Part 3: Build Systems, Frameworks, and Advanced Topics**

### **Module 3.1: Modern Build Systems: CMake and Bazel**

#### **Objective**

To gain proficiency in managing C/C++ projects using the two leading industry-standard build systems, CMake and Bazel. You'll learn how to define targets, manage dependencies, and understand the core philosophy behind each tool.

-----

### **1. Why Do We Need Build Systems?**

For a single file, you can just call the compiler directly (`g++ main.cpp`). But for any real project, you have:

  * Dozens or thousands of source files.
  * Dependencies on third-party libraries.
  * Different build configurations (Debug vs. Release).
  * The need to compile on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

A build system automates this entire process, ensuring your project is built correctly and consistently every time.

-----

### **2. CMake: The Cross-Platform Standard ðŸ”¨**

CMake is a **build system generator**. You don't use CMake to build your code directly; you use it to *generate* the project files for a native build system like Makefiles (on Linux) or Visual Studio solutions (on Windows).

**Core Concepts:**

  * **`CMakeLists.txt`**: The central configuration file for a directory.
  * **Target**: An executable (`add_executable`) or a library (`add_library`).
  * **Modern CMake**: Modern practice focuses on **targets**. You "attach" properties like include directories and library links directly to a target. This is far more robust than the old method of manipulating global variables.

**Example Project Structure:**

```
my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.cpp
â””â”€â”€ include/
    â””â”€â”€ my_project/
        â””â”€â”€ utils.h
```

**Top-Level `CMakeLists.txt`:**

```cmake
# Set the minimum required CMake version and define the project
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(MyProject CXX)

# Add the 'src' subdirectory, which contains our targets
add_subdirectory(src)
```

**`src/CMakeLists.txt`:**

```cmake
# Create a library target for our utility functions
add_library(Utils utils.cpp)

# A library needs to expose its header files. We specify that any target
# linking against 'Utils' should automatically get the 'include' directory.
target_include_directories(Utils PUBLIC ../include)


# Create the main executable target
add_executable(MyApp main.cpp)

# Link our application against our utility library. CMake handles the dependency.
target_link_libraries(MyApp PRIVATE Utils)
```

**Dependency Management:**

  * **`find_package()`**: Finds pre-installed libraries (e.g., `find_package(Boost REQUIRED)`).
  * **`FetchContent`**: Downloads and builds a dependency from source during the configure step. This is great for self-contained projects.

-----

### **3. Bazel: The Scalable Monorepo Builder ðŸš€**

Bazel is a build tool developed by Google, designed for correctness, reproducibility, and speed, especially in very large, multi-language projects (monorepos).

**Core Philosophy:**

  * **Hermeticity**: Builds are run in a sandbox. They can only access dependencies that are explicitly declared, preventing "it works on my machine" issues.
  * **Reproducibility**: If the source code and dependencies haven't changed, the output will be bit-for-bit identical.
  * **Scalability**: Bazel aggressively caches every action. If you (or a teammate) have built something before, Bazel will fetch it from a shared cache instead of rebuilding it.

**Core Concepts:**

  * **`WORKSPACE`**: The file at the root of a project that defines external dependencies.
  * **`BUILD` file**: Defines build targets for a directory, written in a Python dialect called Starlark.
  * **Target**: A rule like `cc_library` or `cc_binary`.

**Example with the Same Project Structure:**

**`WORKSPACE` file (at project root):**

```python
# Defines the project root. For now, it can be empty.
```

**`src/BUILD` file:**

```python
# my_build_exercise/BUILD
# Defines the C++ library target
cc_library(
    name = "utils_lib",
    srcs = ["src/utils.cpp"],
    hdrs = ["include/my_project/utils.h"],
    # This is the key fix. It tells Bazel that the "include" directory
    # should be treated as an include path root. This allows your
    # #include "my_project/utils.h" to work correctly.
    strip_include_prefix = "include",
)

# Defines the C++ executable target
cc_binary(
    name = "my_app",
    srcs = ["src/main.cpp"],
    # Specifies the dependency on our library target
    deps = [":utils_lib"],
)
```


To build you run: `bazel build //:my_app`.

### **4. CMake vs. Bazel: When to Choose?**

| Feature | CMake | Bazel |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | Flexible, un-opinionated, works with existing tools. | Strict, opinionated, focused on correctness and speed. |
| **Best For** | Open-source libraries, cross-platform projects of all sizes. | Large monorepos, multi-language projects, companies. |
| **Strengths** | Ubiquitous, huge ecosystem, great IDE support. | Blazing fast incremental builds, hermeticity, remote caching. |
| **Weaknesses** | Can be slow on large projects, script language is less strict. | Steeper learning curve, more boilerplate for small projects. |

-----

### **Practical Exercise for Module 3.1**

**Task:** Take a simple C++ project and write build scripts for it using *both* CMake and Bazel.

**Project Setup:**

1.  Create the same file structure as the examples above:
      * `my_build_exercise/`
      * `include/my_project/utils.h`
      * `src/utils.cpp`
      * `src/main.cpp`
2.  **`utils.h`**: Declare a function, e.g., `void print_message();`.
3.  **`utils.cpp`**: Define the `print_message()` function. Have it print something simple.
4.  **`main.cpp`**: Include `my_project/utils.h` and call `print_message()`.

**Your Tasks:**

1.  **CMake:** Write the `CMakeLists.txt` files (one at the root, one in `src/`) required to build the `MyApp` executable. Generate the build files and compile your project.
2.  **Bazel:** Write the `WORKSPACE` and `src/BUILD` files required to build the `my_app` executable. Use `bazel build` to compile it.

This exercise will solidify your understanding of how each system organizes source code, defines libraries, and links dependencies.
